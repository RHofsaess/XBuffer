This repository provides some tools to enhance the integration of HPC into WLCG. It especially aims at the mitigation of data access bottlenecks.\
Additionally, tools and scripts for optimizing the operation of such (opportunistic) resources are provided.

The goal is to provide a setup that can run with minimal permissions on most HPC centers!

## Scripts
